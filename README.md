# Parallel Programmig Examples in C++
This repository contains example code for common parallel programming libraries for C++.  
My goal is to provide simple examples as I learn them in the first quarter of 2016, with the hope that this will be useful to beginners.

I intend to cover the following libraries:  
1. pthread  
2. OpenMP   
3. MPI  
4. Intel SIMD  

## How to run  
I have only tested this on OSx so far. In order to run the examples here, you will need to have g++ compiler installed. 

1. Download the repository: `$ git clone https://github.com/angadgill/Parallel-Programming-Examples`
2. Execute make: `$ make`
3. Execute any file you wish, e.g. `$ ./pthread_mutex_example`
